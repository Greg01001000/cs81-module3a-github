0. greet(name): Displays a friendly welcome message addressed to the person with the name passed as an argument.

1. findPrimes(limit): Declaration of function to find all prime numbers from 2 to the argument (limit). Returns an array in which each index that is a prime points to a value of 1, and each index that is not a prime points to a value of 0.

2. showPrimes(limit): Function definition to display all prime numbers from 2 to the argument (limit). Calls findPrimes(limit) to find primes, and then uses console.log() to show all indexes in the returned array which point to a value of 1.

3. circle(radius): Arrow function receives a circle's radius as an argument and displays the diameter, circumference, & area using console.log().

4. sumAverage(...theArgs): Function declaration receives any quantity of numeric arguments and returns a two-element array: arr[0] is sum of all arguments, arr[1] is their average.

5. hypotenuse(sideA, sideB): Single-expression arrow function receives lengths of two short sides of a right triangle and calculates length of the hypotenuse (the square root of the sum of the squared lengths).
