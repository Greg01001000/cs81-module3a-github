**REFLECTION**

**What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?**   
I already knew that Git is an excellent, popular software version control system, and that GitHub is an excellent, popular way to share projects and collaborate, but I didn’t know any details about how those things are done. So I learned that GitHub provides free, unlimited storage (with some caveats), and I learned the minimum (I think) required steps to do version control on a project and publish it on GitHub.

**What was most confusing or frustrating?**   
I was alarmed when I checked my GitHub repository and it no longer showed a commit which it had shown earlier. I tried to find a way to see all commits and eventually found that if I select one file and then click “History”, it shows all the commits involving that file (which showed my earlier commit), but I never found a way to see all commits for all files in the repository. I’m puzzled if that’s not available, and puzzled that seeing all commits isn’t easier, even though I understand that it’s sensible for the main repository page to initially only show the most recent commit for each file.

**Why do you think developers use Git?**   
I know from experience that managing and keeping track of updates and progressive work on software can be a nightmare, even if only one person is editing the files. Collaborative work can expand that problem exponentially. If Git helps keep that problem under control, that explains why it’s popular. The fact that it’s free is a big bonus.

**How might this help with larger projects in the future?**  
On large projects, one often must preserve the last working version while making changes that introduce bugs, often even into previously working portions of the program. And if one thinks of an alternate approach which might be better, one might want to make a different version to compare the two. And if one’s boss says, “Stop working on that; we urgently need a different change made. You can resume what you’re doing after the urgent change is done.” All those situations introduce additional versions which must be preserved and tracked so everyone concerned can see the status and functionality of each version. And if more than one person is making changes to the same file, keeping track of all changes is even more important so the workers don’t interfere with each other’s work, and all beneficial changes can be combined into one file at some point. Git and GitHub can help a lot with that.
